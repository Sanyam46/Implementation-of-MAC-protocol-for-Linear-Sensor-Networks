The main goal of the project is to implement and evaluate a wireless MAC (Medium Access Control) protocol for linear sensor networks using network simulator (NS-2.35).
Currently(as on Feb-15,2024) , I am working on Research paper : A scalable and energy efficient MAC protocol for Linear Sensor Networks. 
Till now , I have created a scenario in which a network is configured where multiple nodes are generating traffic using Constant Bit Rate (CBR) applications. Each node is equipped with a User Datagram Protocol (UDP) agent, responsible for sending and receiving packets. The CBR applications attached to each UDP agent generate traffic with a specified packet size and interval, simulating data transmission within the network. These agents and applications are connected to a "sink node" where data is collected or monitored. The script sets up connections between the UDP agents and a null agent attached to the sink node, facilitating data transmission and reception. As the simulation progresses, packets are transmitted from the source nodes to the sink node, allowing for the observation and analysis of network performance metrics such as packet delivery ratio, throughput, and latency.
